## About

This project is a small Scrapy-based crawler that collects information about movies from Russian Wikipedia and IMDb.

It contains two spiders:
- **moviespider** — collects basic movie information from Wikipedia, including the IMDb ID.
- **imdbratingspider** — uses the IMDb ID to fetch the movie’s IMDb rating.

The project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and shows how to combine data from Wikipedia and IMDb in a structured way.
